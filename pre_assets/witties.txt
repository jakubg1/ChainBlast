// This is the first line of Witties. Lines starting with "//" are not parsed, so you can put comments in here. Like you know that I ate cooked chicken with potatoes and mayo salad? Only people who are brave enough to datamine this game will ever read this, but to be honest until anyone gets to read this, this information going to be irrelevant by then.
"If you always bid the minimum, you're certainly not having fun."
You know, to be honest, no matter how many lines I put inside this text file, they will sooner or later start to repeat. Like come on, is it even worth coming up with this many? Probably no one does even read these. Heck, even this one has probably already vanished because you've selected a menu option already! And if you somehow manage to see this, it's because you left this game running idle for way too long! Maybe try saving energy and reducing your electricity bills? Oh yes, look how this message is getting really long now. This will be a really good test of witty comment renderer, haha! So much effort, but I'm too lazy to make a simple duplicate check. So, maybe you'll see this message twice in a row?
Fun fact: I've created these stupid lines to display on your screen because this is still better than an empty space!
Challenge: Catch as many grammar errors in these lines as you can!
Oh one one eight, nine nine nine. Eight eight one nine nine, nine one one nine, seven-two-five.            Three.
